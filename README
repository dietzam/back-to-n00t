Project back-to-n00t

Portion of SHV-E210S' Android 4.4.4 Touchwiz firmware to GT-I9300


We love XDA. We love to share things and make things better.

Me too. I love to apply things from other developers. But with proper credits.

I'd like to see other developers take commits from this repository and make things better. Contribute to the entire community.

But with proper credits.

'Open' does not mean 'no-respect'. Leave credits to original author and developer.

That's all I want.
